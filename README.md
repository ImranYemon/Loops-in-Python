🔁 Python Loops: for vs while
In Python, loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times. The two main types of loops are: <br>
For Loop <br>
While Loop

✅ for Loop
Best used when you know how many times you want to iterate.
Commonly used with sequences like lists, strings, or range().

🔄 while Loop
Best used when you don’t know how many times the loop should run—loop continues as long as a condition is True.

🔁 Loop Control Statements
Python also provides control flow tools to manage loops:<br>
break – Exit the loop immediately <br>
continue – Skip the current iteration<br>
pass – (Yes, Python allows pass with loops!)

Both loops are powerful and have their place depending on the situation. Understanding when to use each is key to writing clean and efficient Python code. 🚀
